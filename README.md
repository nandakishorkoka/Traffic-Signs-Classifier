## Traffic Signs Classifier 

Overview
---
The project is part of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. In this project, a convolutional neural network is implemented in TensorFlow to classify traffic signs. The model is trained and validated using traffic sign images from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The model is also evaluated on random traffic sign images from the web 

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nandakishorkoka/Traffic-Signs-Classifier.git
cd Traffic-Signs-Classifier
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```
